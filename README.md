Fairylights
===========

I was looking at converting cheap fairy lights that run on 3V to an ESP8266 (Nodemcu) controlled fairy light light switch that i could plug into my home assistant MQTT based home controller.
Lights are dimmable using PWM over D2
DS18B20 was used to measure temperature at the room over D1 pin
